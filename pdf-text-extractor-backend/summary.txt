This paper presents a deterministic inventory model for deteriorating items that allows for shortages and partial backlogging. The model assumes a constant deterioration rate, a linear time-dependent demand rate, and a variable backlogging rate dependent on the time until the next replenishment. The authors aim to minimize the total inventory cost through an analytical solution, building upon previous research that often assumed either full backlogging or lost sales during shortages. The model considers the reality that some customers are willing to wait, with the backlogging rate decreasing as the waiting time increases.
